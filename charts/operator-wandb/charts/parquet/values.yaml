resources:
  # We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a
  # conscious choice for the user. This also increases chances charts run on
  # environments with little resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to
  # specify resources, uncomment the following lines, adjust them as necessary,
  # and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.
