## NOTICE
#
# Due to the scope and complexity of this chart, all possible values are not
# documented in this file. Extensive documentation is available.
#
# Because properties are regularly added, updated, or relocated, it is _strongly
# suggest_ to not "copy and paste" this YAML. Please provide Helm only those
# properties you need, and allow the defaults to be provided by the version of
# this chart at the time of deployment.

# The global properties are used to configure multiple charts at once.
